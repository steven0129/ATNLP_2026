    "## Lab 1 – Evaluating Language Models: hands-on with MMLU\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this lab session is for you to get familiar with autoregressive language models, in particular we will work with a historically relevant model: GPT-2. You can find the huggingface model card [here](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2). \n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to set up the basic code to _evaluate_ GPT-2 on a multiple choice question-answering task (MCQA). This will involve downloading the data (2.) and inspecting it so that we understand how to build a prompt (3.). In other Tutorials we will experiment a bit more on how different prompts interact with different models, so it is important to understand how to dynamically generate prompts, in this Lab we will introduce `langchain`'s `PromptTeplate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are different ways in which one could evaluate the model on MCQA. We will choose to implement one that compares the average log-probabilities over the tokens of the different possible answers (4.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab should be runnable on CPU (albeit slightly slow). You can try to use [google colab's](https://colab.research.google.com/) free tier GPU. "
