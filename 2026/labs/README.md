# ATNLP Labs

Here you can find the 4 ATNLP Labs. These are simple exercises that teach the basics of some widely used tools in current NLP, both in industry and academia.

The labs are jupyter-notebooks (.ipynb files), which combine markdown and code. If you have never used a jupyter notebook, make sure you have `jupyter` installed. It is recommended to use them with your favourite IDE. If you use Visual Studio Code, you can find a tutorial on how to set everything up [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
